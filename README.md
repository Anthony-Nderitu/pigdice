## Description
This is a website for a game called Pig Dice that was designed to entertain customers. This is basically how it works. You roll the dice and the number you land on is added to the overall score except:
- if you roll a 1 your total score reverts back to 0 and you start again.
## Specifications
- When you click roll a random number is generated between 1 and 6
   - Example click roll.
   - Example Output : 2
- An image of a dice is displayed equal to the random number generated.
- The random number generated is added to the overall score.
    - Example Output : 5 + 6 = 11
- If the number generated is equal to 1 the score returns to 0
    - Example roll 1
    - Example Output : total score = 0
- If the total score is equal to the inputed final score the game ends and a button is clicked to start a new game.
